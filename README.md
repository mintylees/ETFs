Index Description According to the Index Provider
The StrataQuant® Technology Index is an "enhanced" index developed, maintained and sponsored by ICE Data Indices, LLC or its affiliates ("IDI") which employs the AlphaDEX® stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Russell 1000® Index.
IDI constructs the StrataQuant® Technology Index by ranking the stocks which are members of the Russell 1000® Index on growth factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. All stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the growth factors and, separately, all stocks are ranked on the sum of ranks for the value factors.
Each stock receives either its growth or value score rank as its selection score based on its style designation as determined by Russell. Stocks which Russell allocates between both growth and value receive the better of their growth or value score rank as their selection score.
IDI then ranks those stocks contained in the technology sector according to their score. The greater of the top 75% of the eligible universe or 40 stocks is selected for the StrataQuant® Technology Index.
If the total count of eligible stocks in the technology sector falls below 40, all eligible stocks will be included.
The selected stocks are divided into quintiles based on their rankings and the top ranked quintiles receive a higher weight within the index. The stocks are equally-weighted within each quintile.
The index is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly.
